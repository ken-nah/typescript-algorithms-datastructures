# Typescript Algorithms and Data Structures

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ken-nah/typescript-algorithms-datastructures/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=WCX2P8PSND)](https://codecov.io/gh/ken-nah/typescript-algorithms-datastructures)

This repository will contain Typescript based examples of many popular algorithms and data structures. It is an attempt to implement all kind of widely used **Algorithms** and **Data Structures** in the programming world using Typescript. Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate folder
with related unit tests.

_Note that this project is meant to be used for learning and researching purposes
only._
