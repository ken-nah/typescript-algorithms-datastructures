/*
 * There is an array with some dict. All dict are equal except for one.
 * Try to find it!
 * Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 dict.
 * Example:
 * findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) == 2
 * findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.2, 0, 0 ]) == 0.2
 * The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.
