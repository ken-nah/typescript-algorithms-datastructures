# BubbleSort

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping array adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

## How it works

1. Start at the beginning of the array comparing the first element with the second element.
2. If the first element is greater than the second element, then swap the two elements.
3. Continue with this process for the rest of the array elements each time incrementing the current index by one, comparing the current element with the next element.
4. After the first iteration, the largest element will be at the end of the array.
5. Repeat the process for the second largest element and so on until the array is sorted.

## Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Space Complexity: O(1)
